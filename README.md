# MAP of NOTMAR and NOTAM SpaceX Starship Test Flight 7
Couldn't find a Map showing the NOTMAR and NOTAM SpaceX gave for [Starship Test Flight 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_flight_test_7), here it is:

![Map with NOTAM and NOTMAR for SpaceX Starship Test Flight 7](Map_NOTMAR_NOTAM_SpaceX_Starship_Test_Flight_7.png "Map with NOTAM and NOTMAR for SpaceX Starship Test Flight 7")

Note that the air warning (NOTAM) area is significantly smaller than the sea warning (NOTMAR). Please correct me with an issue if you can find more NOTAMs. I used the FAA historic search but couldn't find more.
